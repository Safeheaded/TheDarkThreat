While getting closer and closer 
to the place of his destination, 
villagers started to warn him of the 
dark forces hiding in nearby 
woods. He also learned of an
old crypt, hidden deep in the heart
of the forest. This is where he
should look for the roots of evil.
And he knew that he was ought to
destroy all evil wandering around.
